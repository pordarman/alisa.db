# How to download?

- First we create a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) file (If you have not downloaded [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to computer before, you can download node.js by [clicking here](https://nodejs.org/en/))

- Then we open the PowerShell terminal by "shift + right click" on the folder of the file you created.

- Then we write **npm i alisa.db** and press enter.

- And now we have downloaded the **alisa.db** module, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰



<br>

# What is this module?

- This module was established to facilitate people using JSON database

- This module, which contains as many commands and features as you would like, is *perfect*, just like the man/woman of your dreams

- There are commands and features that you can customize almost anything

- This module was made with the sole purpose of helping people, without generating any income

<br>

# So how to use?

It's very simple, first you have to open any node.js file and write the following in it:
<br>
```js
const Database = new (require("alisa.db"))()
```
After typing this you can access **all** commands

<br>

# Example

Now, if you want, let me briefly explain how to write data to the database
<br>

```js
// Printing data to database
Database.set("hello", "World!")

// After typing this, the following data is created in the database.json file:
```
![Printing data to database](https://i.hizliresim.com/mnt8zwz.png)
  
As you can see, it is very simple and understandable to use

<br>

And if you want, instead of saving a single data, you can save multiple data at the same time
```js
// Printing multiple data to database
Database.setMany({ hello: "World", test: "Test", alisa: "alisa.db", version: "0.0.3" })

// After typing this, the following data is created in the database.json file:
```

As you can see, we can save time and memory by printing multiple data instead of printing one by one

<br>

# So why alisa.db?

- The first reason is that it is overly simple and less likely to fail

- The second reason is that since it is an open source module, it can be edited in a special way if you want

- The third reason is that we are improving this module every day, making it more performance and adding new features to our strength

- The fourth reason is... Well, I guess there's no other reason :( Maybe it's just to make me happy ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
